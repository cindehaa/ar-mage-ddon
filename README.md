ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Cindy and I'm a current Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Waterloo, expecting to graduate in 2027. I'm deeply passionate about all things tech, but especially software development, AI, and information security. Outside of computer science, I have a love for chess, rock music, and mathematics.

Feel free to reach out to me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cindehaa/) or Discord at cindehaa#0.
